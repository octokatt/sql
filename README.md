# SQL Notes

Most of SQL is easy.  The vast majority is SELECT statements, and deploying saved code from backups.

The rest gets trickier, particularly for creating performant code, making complex SELECT statements, and making decisions on naming conventions and schema design.  

For the simple parts of SQL, using the [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) resource is a fantastic resource to be able to quickly find a refresher.  This is intended to be a resource for the other, stranger parts of SQL.
