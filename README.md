# SQL Notes

This directory is now in [octokatt/wiki/sql](https://github.com/octokatt/wiki/tree/master/sql), so there's just one project of markdowns instead of several.

Formerly, this whole thing was directly linked to GitBooks, and was used to demonstrate knowledge of SQL for my excellent job at Cash App.
